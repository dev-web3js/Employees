Employee Management System
This is a Python program that implements an employee management system. The program is designed to be used by small businesses to manage their employee data. The program allows users to:

Add new employees
Edit existing employees
Delete employees
View a list of all employees
Background
Employee management systems are important for businesses of all sizes. They help businesses to track employee information, such as names, contact information, job titles, and salaries. Employee management systems can also help businesses to generate reports on employee data.

Implementation
The program is implemented using the Python programming language and the Tkinter GUI library. The program uses a SQLite database to store the employee data.

Usage
To use the program, simply run the employee_management_system.py file. The program will display a graphical user interface (GUI) with the following options:

Add Employee
Edit Employee
Delete Employee
View Employees
To add a new employee, click the "Add Employee" button and enter the employee's name, age, job title, email address, gender, mobile phone number, and address. Then, click the "Add" button to save the new employee to the database.

To edit an existing employee, click the "Edit Employee" button and select the employee you want to edit. Then, make the desired changes and click the "Update" button to save the changes to the database.

To delete an employee, click the "Delete Employee" button and select the employee you want to delete. Then, click the "Delete" button to remove the employee from the database.

To view a list of all employees, click the "View Employees" button. The program will display a treeview with a list of all employees. You can double-click on an employee to view their detailed information.

Assumptions and limitations
The program assumes that the database is already created and that the necessary tables exist. The program also assumes that the user has the necessary permissions to access the database.

The program is limited to a maximum of 1000 employees. If you need to store more than 1000 employees, you will need to modify the program accordingly.
